    The homework was done in C++ and for the parse and use of the jsons I used
the nlohmann library. Also, the files request.cpp, reques.h, buffer.cpp,
buffer.h, helpers.cpp and helpers.h are the ones from the laboratory with small
changes. The implementation will present a command prompt for the user.
